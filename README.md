# EGPI
EGPI - Experiment Graphs Properties Identifyer is a research tool that allows users to quickly check interesting properties of graphs describing quantum experiments. It was built in the context of researches on the Krenn's conjecture, defined in https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/graph-theory-question/.

## Run
To run EGPI, you need to have Python 3 and pdflatex installed. Then, you can run the following command from the main directory of this project:
```python sources/main.py```

Follow the instructions in your terminal to perform a random experiment graphs research process.
