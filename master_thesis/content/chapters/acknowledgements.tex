\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{ch:acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my two supervisors, GwenaÃ«l Joret and Yelena Yuditsky, for their help and guidance throughout this master thesis.
We worked a lot together, and most of the results I discovered were found thanks to their help.
In particular, I am very grateful for the level of detail they put in their feedbacks, and for their availability to answer my questions during this year.\\

Then, I'd like to thank the members of the jury for having accepted to evaluate this master thesis.
I do really appreciate the fact they took the time to do it, and I hope they will find it interesting.\\

Next, I would like to thank my physicist friends.
They helped me a lot in understanding the basics of quantum optics that I was lacking, and they played a crucial role in my understanding of the subject.
They have all my gratitude for their time and patience.\\

Finally, a big thank you to my family and friends for their support during this year.
Their presence and advice were always appreciated, and I thank them for having been the guarantors of my mental health in the last weeks preceding the deadline.
Completing this master thesis would have been impossible without them.\\
