\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

Quantum computing has hugely developed in the last few years, with the rise of new technologies and the development of new algorithms.
Advancements made in quantum information and computation promise theoretical ways to solve problems that are currently intractable with classical computers.
It is already used a lot in the field of cryptography~\cite{kumar2021state}, and its potential uses extend to many other fields such as artificial intelligence~\cite{otterbach2017unsupervised}, financial planning and medicine~\cite{hassija2020forthcoming}.
However, quantum computers are still in their infancy and are not yet able to solve a lot of practical problems.
One of the reasons for this is the difficulty to physically create some specific quantum states.\\

In its research, the physicist Mario Krenn has been working on the generation of high-dimensional multipartite quantum states~\cite{Krenn_2017}.
In this same paper, he discovered a new surprising link between the generation of these quantum states and a specific problem in graph theory.
The problem was summarized by Mario Krenn himself on his website~\cite{wordpress}.
Furthermore, to promote research on the subject, the physicist promised a reward of 3000€ to the first person who will solve his conjecture, and an additional reward of 1000€ was offered during the last $2$ years to the best paper on the subject~\cite{wordpress}.
This problem, that we will refer to as the \textit{Krenn's conjecture}, is about proving the existence of a bound on a quantity called the \textit{weighted matching index} of a graph.
It introduces a unique form of vertex colourings in graphs that incorporates perfect matchings, and that was never investigated before.
It will be defined in details in Chapter~\ref{ch:description-of-the-problem} of this thesis.\\

The main points of this master thesis are the following: first, the Krenn's conjecture will be rigorously defined.
This will be done through a progressive approach, starting from reminders of basic graph theory concepts (section~\ref{sec:prerequisites-and-used-notations}), then looking at a simplified version of the conjecture (section~\ref{sec:simplified-version-of-the-conjecture}), and at last introducing the Krenn's conjecture (section~\ref{sec:krenn_conjecture}).
This definition will be directly followed by a detailed explanation of its physical interpretations (section~\ref{sec:motivations}).\\

Then, a state of the art in the domain will be established in Chapter~\ref{ch:state-of-the-art}.
In dressing the state of the art, we will focus on the special cases of the problem that were already solved by other researchers.
Also, we will rewrite some proofs in our own terms, to get a better understanding of the reasoning.\\

Lastly, I will present my own new contributions to the problem, which can be summarized in $2$ main points.
Firstly, I proved by using a theoretical approach a new special case of the Krenn's conjecture in Chapter~\ref{ch:new-contributions}.
This proof will be presented by taking a simple known case of the problem, and then relaxing some of its constraints to generalize it.
And secondly, I'm introducing a new tool I developed, called EGPI, to experimentally test the conjecture on a large number of graphs in Chapter~\ref{ch:computational-approach}.
The use cases and technical implementation of this tool will be discussed in the sections~\ref{sec:functionalities-of-egpi} and~\ref{sec:details-of-implementation} of this chapter.
At last, and to finish this master thesis, I present some experimental results I got using EGPI, and my interpretation of them in section~\ref{sec:realized_experiments}.\\
