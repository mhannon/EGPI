\label{ch:aknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my two supervisors, GwenaÃ«l Joret and Yelena Yuditsky, for their help and guidance throughout this master thesis.
We worked a lot together, and I am very grateful for the time they spent on me.
Most of the results I discovered were found thanks to their help, and I am very thankful for that.\\

Then, I would like to thank my old colleagues from my previous physics science studies.
They helped me a lot in understanding the basics of quantum optics that I was lacking, and that were crucial in the context of this master thesis.
They have all my gratitude for their time and patience.\\

I would also like to thank the members of the jury for having accepted to evaluate this master thesis.
I am very grateful for the time they will spend on it, and I hope they will find it interesting.\\

Finally, a huge thank you to my family and friends for their support during this year.
Their presence and advises were always appreciated, and I thank them for being the guarantors of my mental health in the last weeks preceding the deadline.
Completing this master thesis would have been impossible without them.\\
